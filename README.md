# Golo, a lightweight dynamic language for the JVM.

> The world didn't need another JVM language.
> So we built yet another one. A simple one.

Golo is a simple dynamic, weakly-typed language for the JVM.

Built from day 1 with `invokedynamic`, Golo takes advantage of the latest advances of
the JVM. It is also a showcase on how to build a language runtime with `invokedynamic`.

Eclipse Golo was originally created by [Julien Ponge](https://julien.ponge.org/)
and developed as part of the research activities of the
[DynaMid](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr/) group of the
[CITI Laboratory](http://www.citi-lab.fr/) at
[INSA-Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/).

Eclipse Golo is a _mature_ Eclipse Technology Project.

## Getting Golo

Golo follows the [semantic versioning scheme](http://semver.org).

Go to the [Golo downloads page](https://golo-lang.org/download/) for general download instructions.

You can fetch Golo from Maven central under the `org.eclipse.golo` group.

## Building Golo

### Dependencies

Golo is built with [Gradle](https://gradle.org).
Since the source code contains the [Gradle wrapper scripts](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html),
the build can bootstrap itself by downloading the qualified Gradle version from the Internet.

### Java virtual machine compatibility

Golo requires Java 8 to build.
Building beyond Java 8 is currently disabled: at this time Golo is not fully compatible with the changes introduced in Java 9
and the _Java Platform Module System_.

In practice you can run most Golo code with Java 11 and beyond, but you may see some reflection-related warnings.

### Building

Common tasks:

* build: `./gradlew build`
* test: `./gradlew test`
* clean: `./gradlew clean`
* documentation: `./gradlew asciidoctor golodoc javadoc`
* assemble a working distribution in `build/install`: `./gradlew installDist`
* generate a nice JaCoCo tests coverage report: `./gradlew jacocoTestReport`

The complete list of tasks is available by running `./gradlew tasks`.
